###My task was to create Passenger class, but I'm still figuring out what/how to do this.
I have to create Passenger class with instance variables but I feel sooo lost..###


#this should include basic attributes such as
#priority number
#seat number
#ticket number
#age

#from Daniel's code:

class Passenger(object):
    
    def __init__(self, name, priority):
        self.name = name
        self.priority = priority


#do I just add stuff within the parenthesis? what do I do to add other variables??
