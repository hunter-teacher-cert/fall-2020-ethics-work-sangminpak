Memorandum

To all students, staff, and parents/guardians:

As some of us are planning to return to the building for 2020-2021 school year, we believe that it is our duty to do anything necessary to keep our school community safe and healthy. We have discussed for days on end during this summer to figure out how to create the safest environment for both students and staff and come to a decision that in addition to all the other safety protocols, a rigorous contact tracing process was necessary.
	In our research, we found that there are overwhelming tracing apps with vastly different range of functionality and privacy. For example, some apps are GPS based, and notifies users if they are near a “COVID hotspot,” or other ones would only use Bluetooth which only tracks proximity. 
Starting September 8th, everyone who enters the school building must have the app called “StaySafe” downloaded. The tracing app “StaySafe” will utilize the proximity tracking via Bluetooth within the school building, while users can opt in for GPS-based tracking system outside the building. We believe that “StaySafe” was the best choice among all the contact tracing app since this app protects your privacy since it does not collect any location data and is easier to anonymize. However, you can always opt in to provide location data for additional contact tracing information.
In addition to manual tracing of the members of our community, this tracing app will provide even more transparency and be a useful supplement to manual tracing efforts. Thank you for all your hard work to keep our community safe.
